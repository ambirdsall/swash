# Swash

Skies of Arcadia and Zelda games are great: both have straightforward
adventure, simple but deep combat systems (based on tactical CHOICES more than
rote execution; that use good music programmatically; and that resolve before
they wear out their welcome), and plots excavated through world exploration.
More of that! First draft is going to look a lot like a 'Skies of Arcadia'
ripoff, because it will be.

## Music
120 bpm is standard; maybe things can speed up during a boss fight or such?

Anyway, the standard exists to make layering easy. Layering, along with a new
technology called "melodies", enables a very simple theme for a region to be
programmatically varied as players explore different areas within it. Each area
has a unique, distinctive set of clips it loops.

Layering different tempi at the same rhythm enables shifting polyrhythms and
chords, which is just basically the shit, and enables really cool, distinctive
feels for different areas.

## Geo(graph|metr)y
At all times, the player is in an area; and every area is within a region. Every
region has a musical theme; every area has a unique variation on that theme. The
only exception is maybe if location is trumped by a surprise boss fight; but
encounters should be geographically determined.
### Regions
1. have one or two areas that are significant to the plot or that are subplots:
  * unlock an ability
  * treasure
  * a monster terrorizing an island
  * find a ship
  * enemy camp
  * etc etc

2. have habited places (all cities and towns are safe)

## Combat philosophy
### Turn-based
### Group
  * group "power up" for special attacks small and then (as you level up) large
  * 4-5 actions chosen and then batch executed with the enemy's attacks
    added in (order semi-random, weighted by enemy speed)

### Modal
#### Foot
#### Ship
### Encounters
Not sure about the proper frequency, degree of scripting vs algorithms, etc
The fundamental act should be exploration, not combat
### Normal Combat
### Bosses
